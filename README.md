# Ningov Spellpoint System
A customization of Misthero's Spellpoint system to support using items instead of a spellpoint resource.  Specific for the Ningov game, but might be useful in other
games where magic is managed by items instead of classes.
 
## Installation Instructions
Still working on instructions. Stay tuned

**Notice**: Slots won't disappear from character sheets, but they will always stay full as long as this module is enabled.

## Features
- Configurable spell cost in spell points if you use any homebrew system.
- Optionally you can enable a variant rule to allow players to keep casting even when they run out of spellpoints using their own life with terrible consequences if you are using the **[Advanced Magic - Spell Point System 5e!](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272967/Advanced-Magic--Spell-Points-System-5e)** available as "Pay what you Want" on DriveThruRPG.
- Configurable health loss for casting using the Gritty High Magic Variant.

### Incompatibility
For now: Advanced Magic - Spell Points System 5e  
Least till I can find a clean way to do both at the same time.

## CHANGELOG

- 1.0.0 First custom release
