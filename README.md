# Ningov Spellpoint System
A Fork of Misthero's Spellpoint system to support using items instead of a spellpoint resource.  Specific for the Ningov game, but might be useful in other
games where magic is managed by items instead of class levels.
 
## Installation Instructions
- Ensure you have enabled the Module.
- Create an item with an active effect labeled "Spell Points"
- Ensure the item has charges (you'll need to mark an Activation Cost, though this will only be used for the Limited Uses field.)
- Attune to the item.
- When you cast, it should automatically deduct from any foci in the character's inventory.

**Notice**: Slots won't disappear from character sheets, but they will always stay full as long as this module is enabled.

## Features
- Configurable spell cost in spell points if you use any homebrew system.

## Plans
- Make the effect label configurable
- Perhaps use something other than an effect?  If an item had a specific "spell point" feature, that might  
be easier to manage.

### Incompatibility
For now: Advanced Magic - Spell Points System 5e  
As it modifies the same pieces as this system.

## CHANGELOG

- 1.0.0 First custom release
